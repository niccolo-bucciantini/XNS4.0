# Examples in GR

Here we present a few examples to show how to work with the code and the related performances. All
cases have been run on a simple laptop

## Rotating, unmagnetised NS in GR with the ??? EoS

Description.

Here are the main parameters used to compute this model. The detailed log with all the parameters can be found in the corresponding LogFile.dat.

```
PARAM1 = VALUE1, PARAM2 = VALUE2, PARAM3 = VALUE3, PARAM4 = VALUE4, ...
```
