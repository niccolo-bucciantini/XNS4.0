# Files and outputs

Here is a list of all the files and subroutines included int the XNS package, together with a brief
description of what they do and how they operates. We start with the Fortran 90 files of the code (with
extension *.f90*), then we describe the output files produced by a run (with extension *.dat*), and we conclude
with the Python 3 files needed for visualisation (with extension *.py* or *.ipynb*, for use in Jupyter). The code
must run in double precision for convergence. The *makefile* is provided for the gfortran (GNU) compiler. For more
info on the compilation of XNS, see section "Compiling XNS".

## Files

- **XNS.f90** - main program. Makes some consistency checks, and invokes XNSMAIN. Depending on
the pre-compiling option it simply calls XNSMAIN (if make serial is used to compile the code), or it
performs a Newton-Raphson search for an equilibrium model with a given value for a desired quantity
of interest, i.e. a certain value of the central density or gravitational mass (if make nwtrps is used). Moreover, it can compute many models in parallel with different initial conditions (if make parspace is used).
<br><br>
- **XNSMAIN.f90**
    - subroutine **XNSMAIN** - the main kernel of the code: it defines the grid, builds a 2D initial guess based on the 1D TOV output of TOVINIMOD.f90, performs the convergence loop calling all the various metric solvers and procedures in the appropriate order. When the loop is over, it writes all the outputs.
    - subroutine **CONFORMAL** - solves for the scalar Poisson-like equation for $\psi$.
    - subroutine **LAPSE** - solves for the scalar Poisson-like equation for $\alpha \psi$.
    - subroutine **SHIFTPHI** - solves the $\phi$ component of the two vector Poisson equations for $W^i$ and $\beta ^i$, given the corresponding source terms.
    - subroutine **CURV1** - computes the curvature source term in the routines for $\psi$ and $\alpha \psi$.
    - subroutine **CURV2** - computes the curvature source term in the routine for $\beta ^\phi$.
    - subroutine **SOURCECHI** - computes the metric terms and derivatives used in the source terms of the equation for $\chi$.
    - subroutine **SOLVECHI** - solves for the scalar field equation for $\chi$, given the source term. Note that since $\chi$ also appears in the source term, a single call of SOLVECHI won't yield a true solution.
    - subroutine **CHISOL** - wrapper that calls SOURCECHI and CHISOL in a relaxation loop, until it converges to the true solution.
    - subroutine **LEGZO** - computes the zeros of Legendre polynomials and the corresponding
    weights for Gaussian quadrature integration.
    - subroutine **LPN** - computes the Legendre polynomials and their derivatives.
    - subroutine **POLINT** - a polynomial 2nd order interpolation routine (modified from the Numerical Recipes).
<br><br>
- **SYSTEM.f90**
    - module **SYSTEM** - contains various parameters of the run, to be specified by the user, and definitions of common arrays (see section "User parameters").
    - subroutine **EOSTABLEREAD** - reads the EoS file specified by the FILEEOS parameter. Note that the first line in the file must be the number of points present in the file, and this must be equal to the parameter NPTRHO. The subsequent lines must contain the minimum and maximum density and their indexes (second line), the minimum and maximum pressure and their indexes (third line), the minimum and maximum internal energy and their indexes (fourth line), the minimum and maximum enthalpy and their indexes (fifth line). Then, the table is read. Please, refer to the routine code to see the specific structure that the EoS file must have.
    - subroutine **RHO2EOS** - given $\rho$, it computes the pressure $p$, the internal energy $\varepsilon$ and the enthalpy $h$ according to the tabulated EoS.
    - subroutine **PRS2EOS** - given $p$, it computes the $\rho$ according to the tabulated EoS.
    - subroutine **ENT2EOS** - given $h$, it computes the $\rho$ according to the tabulated EoS.
    - subroutine **EOS** - computes the density and the internal energy given the pressure, both in case the EoS is tabulated or an analytical polytropic.
    - subroutine **FUNCD_EOS** - used by the root-finding subroutine to derive the central pressure given
    the central density.
    - subroutine **FUNCD_STRETCH** - used by the root-finding subroutine to derive the stretching factor for the grid, if it is stretched.
    - function **RTSAFEG** - the root-finding subroutine, based on bisection and Newtonâ€™s methods
    (modified from the Numerical Recipes), to derive the central pressure.
<br><br>
- **HYDROEQ.f90**
    - subroutine **HYDROEQ** - given the CFC metric and a value of $\rho _\mathrm{c}$ it computes the equilibrium
    configuration for the corresponding Bernoulli integral. It finally calls
    hydrovar_<x> depending on the physical parameter set in SYSTEMXNS.f90 to compute local
    equilibrium quantities.
    - subroutine **HYDROVAR**, **HYDROVAR_TOR**, **HYDROVAR_POL** - they compute local equilibrium
    quantities such as $\rho$, $p$, $v^\phi$, $B^i$ and $E_i$ depending on the specific choice for the magnetization (respectively unmagnetized case, purely toroidal magnetic field and poloidal magnetic field).
    - subroutine **COVTERM** - computes the local terms of the metric tensor
    - subroutine **CONS_TO_PRIM** - computes the inversion from conserved to primitive variables.
    - subroutine **CONS_TO_PRIM_POL** - computes the inversion from conserved to primitive variables for the specific case of poloidal field.
    - subroutine **QUANTITIES** - computes several quantities (e.g. mass, energy, angular momentum, scalar charge, magnetic deformation) at the end of the convergence loop, according to standard definitions. See also SDB20 for some definitions in the case of STTs.
    - subroutine **SOURCEPOT** - compute source terms (currents and metric) for the Grad-Shafranov
    Equation or Maxwell equations depending if the rotational rate OMG is set to zero or not.
    - subroutine **VECPOTPHI** - called by the subroutine hydrovar_pol when OMG.EQ.0, it solves
    the Grad-Shafranov Equation.
    - subroutine **MXWLSOL** - called by subroutine hydrovar_pol when OMG.NE.0, it solves iteratively the Maxwell-Ampere and the Maxwell-Gauss equation. It finally corrects the solution for the electric potential $\Phi$ in order to guarantee that the MHD condition $\Phi = -\Omega \Psi + C$ is valid
    inside the star. Indeed, as explained in Pili et al. (2017), the solution for $\Phi$ obtained by solving
    the non-homogeneus Maxwell equations, does not satisfy the perfect conducting relation inside
    the star, but differs from the MHD solution solution $\Phi _\mathrm{MHD} = -\Omega \Psi + C$ by an harmonic function
    $\Phi _\mathrm{a}$ so that $\Phi = \Phi _\mathrm{MHD} + \Phi _\mathrm{a}$ with $\Delta \Phi _\mathrm{a} = 0$. The harmonic function is obtained evoking the laplace subroutine.
    - subroutine **SOLVEAPHI** and subroutine **SOLVEATIME** - solve respectively for the Maxwell-Ampere and Maxwell-Gauss equations.
    - subroutine **LAPLACE** - solves the equations $\Phi _\mathrm{a} \big |_{S _\mathrm{NS}} = \Sigma _l Y(\theta) (a_l r^l) |_{S _\mathrm{NS}}$ (inside the star) and $\Phi _\mathrm{a} \big |_{S _\mathrm{NS}} = \Sigma _l Y(\theta) (b_l r^{-(l+1)}) |_{S _\mathrm{NS}}$ (outside the star), where $S _\mathrm{NS}$ is stellar surface and $\Phi _\mathrm{a} \big |_{S _\mathrm{NS}} = (\Phi + \Omega \Psi + C) |_{S _\mathrm{NS}}$. Each system of equations is solved with a LU decomposition and a subsequent backward substitution adopting the routines provided in the Numerical Recipes (ludcmp and
    lubksb). Notice that, in order to avoid spurious effects, the surface terms are evaluated on top
    of the super-ellipsoid that best fit the numerical surface.

    RK4 method.
    - subroutine **RK4** - the 4th order RK integrator (modified from the Numerical Recipes).
    - subroutine **MASSFIND** - computes the ADM mass of the scalarised TOV solution at a given radius (either at the middle of the grid or at its outer edge) by knowing the scalar charge and the value of $\mu$ at that point. It is used in order to achieve convergence, as explained in SBD20 Appendix B.
    - subroutine **CHIDERIVS** - computes the derivatives of the scalar field ($Q^\mu$) and the scalar coupling function $\mathcal{A}(\chi)$.
